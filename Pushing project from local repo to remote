Initialize Git in your project directory
========================================
cd your-project-directory
git init

cd your-project-directory: This command changes the current directory to your project directory.
git init: This initializes a new Git repository in your project directory. It creates a .
git folder where Git stores all the information about the repository

Add your files to the staging area
==================================
git add .

git add .: This command adds all the files in your project directory to the staging area.
The staging area is where you prepare files before committing them to the repository.

Commit your changes
===================
git commit -m "Initial commit"

git commit -m "Initial commit": This command commits the files in the staging area to the repository.
The -m flag allows you to add a commit message, which in this case is "Initial commit".
This message helps you and others understand what changes were made in this commit.

Create a new repository on GitHub
=================================
Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license.
This step is done on the GitHub website.
You need to create a new repository where your project will be stored.

Add the remote repository URL
=============================
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git: This command adds a remote repository URL to your local Git repository.
The remote repository is where your project will be stored on GitHub. origin is the name given to this remote repository.

Push your changes to GitHub
===========================
git push -u origin master

git push -u origin master: This command pushes your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
origin refers to the remote repository you added earlier, and master is the default branch name.
The -u flag sets origin master as the default upstream branch, so future git push commands will automatically push to this branch.
I hope this helps! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
